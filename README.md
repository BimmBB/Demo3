# RSA Calculator

This project assists users in encrypting a message and decrypting an encrypted message using RSA.

## Project Description

Users can input prime numbers p, q, m, e, and n generated by the encryption process with Big Integer data type into text fields. The calculator will compute decryption and output the result on the screen.

## Main Functions

1. Encryption
    - Users can input a text message.
    - The calculator will generate prime numbers p and q with Big Integer data type.
    - The calculator computes encryption and outputs the encrypted result to a file named `output.txt`.
   
2. Decryption
    - Users can input prime numbers p, q, m, e, and n generated by the encryption process with Big Integer data type into text fields.
    - The calculator will compute decryption and output the result on the screen.

## How to Use the Project

1. Download or copy this project's code into a Java development environment.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you've saved the project code.
3. Compile the `Encryption.java` file using the command: `javac Encryption.java`.
4. Run the program using the command: `java Encryption`.
5. The program will request input text for encryption. Ensure the text length does not exceed 1024 characters.
6. After the encryption process completes, the program will generate the `output.txt` file containing ciphertext, e-value, n-value, and p-value after the encryption process finishes.
